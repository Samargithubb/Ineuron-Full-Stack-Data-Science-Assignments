    "- Computation paradigm: NumPy follows an eager computation paradigm, where operations are executed immediately. TensorFlow, on the other hand, follows a symbolic computation paradigm, where computations are defined as a computational graph and executed later within a TensorFlow session.\n",
    "- Automatic differentiation: TensorFlow provides automatic differentiation, which is crucial for training deep learning models through techniques like backpropagation. NumPy does not have built-in automatic differentiation.\n",
    "- GPU acceleration: TensorFlow is designed to leverage the computational power of GPUs and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for accelerated training and inference. NumPy primarily relies on CPU computations.\n",
    "- Distributed computing: TensorFlow offers built-in support for distributed computing, allowing users to train and deploy models across multiple devices or machines. NumPy does not have native distributed computing capabilities."

    "\n",
    "- **Placeholders:** Placeholders are used to feed external data into TensorFlow computational graphs. They act as empty nodes that can be filled with data at runtime. However, in TensorFlow 2.0 and later versions, placeholders have been replaced with the tf.data API and the use of eager execution.\n",

    "- **Sparse Tensors:** Sparse Tensors are used to efficiently represent and manipulate tensors with a significant number of elements that are zeros. They are particularly useful in tasks involving sparse data, such as natural language processing or recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ragged Tensors:** Ragged Tensors are used to represent tensors with variable lengths along one or more dimensions. They are suitable for handling sequences or data with irregular shapes, such as sentences of varying lengths or batches of variable-sized images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed Tensors:** TensorFlow provides functionality for distributing tensors across multiple devices or machines. Distributed Tensors enable parallel processing and scaling of computations across a cluster of machines or GPUs."
