The ReLU function is given by f(x) = max(0, x). ReLU functions are useful in deep neural networks because they are computationally efficient and can prevent the problem of vanishing gradients.\n",

It maps the inputs to a set of values that sum to 1, representing probabilities for each class. The softmax function is given by the formula f(x_i) = exp(x_i) / sum(exp(x_j)).\n",
