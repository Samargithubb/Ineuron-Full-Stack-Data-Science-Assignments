        "Ans: Heteroscedasticity in regression occurs when the variability of the errors is not constant across the range of the independent variables. It can lead to biased and inefficient coefficient estimates, invalid hypothesis tests, inaccurate prediction intervals, and can be detected through residual analysis. Addressing heteroscedasticity may involve transformations, weighted least squares, robust standard errors, or utilizing generalized linear models depending on the specific circumstances."

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and becomes too specific to the training data. This can lead to poor performance on new data. Bootstrapping helps to reduce overfitting by creating multiple models that are trained on different subsets of the training data. This means that each model is less likely to overfit to any particular subset of the training data."
