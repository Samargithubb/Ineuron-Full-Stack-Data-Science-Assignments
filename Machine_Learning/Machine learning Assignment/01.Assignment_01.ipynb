    "**Ans:**  Machine learning refers to a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on a task over time, based on data inputs. The algorithms used in machine learning are designed to identify patterns in the data, and use those patterns to make predictions or classifications about new data. Machine learning is used in a wide variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles."

Instead of processing the entire dataset simultaneously, out-of-core learning operates on subsets of the data, processing each subset sequentially. Out-of-core learning is slower than core learning due to the need to repeatedly load data from disk, but it enables the processing of massive datasets that would otherwise be impossible to analyze with traditional machine learning techniques."
