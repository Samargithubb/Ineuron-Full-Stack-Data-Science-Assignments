    "Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and creating features or variables in a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models. In simpler terms, it is the process of identifying the most relevant information from the raw data and preparing it in a way that can be easily understood and processed by machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of feature engineering involves the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Selection:** The first step in feature engineering is to identify the most important features in the dataset. This can be done by analyzing the correlation between the features and the target variable, and by using statistical methods such as variance thresholding, mutual information, and feature importance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Transformation:** Once the important features have been identified, they may need to be transformed to make them more suitable for use in machine learning models. This can involve scaling, normalization and other techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Creation:** In some cases, it may be necessary to create new features or variables from the existing ones. This can be done by combining features, creating interaction terms, or extracting information from unstructured data such as text or images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Extraction:** Feature extraction involves reducing the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming the features into a new space that captures the most important information. This can be done using techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)\n",
