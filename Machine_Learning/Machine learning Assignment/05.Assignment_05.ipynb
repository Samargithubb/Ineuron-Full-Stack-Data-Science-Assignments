    "Data pre-processing is a critical step in machine learning that involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis. It aims to improve the quality and consistency of the data by handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and transforming the data into a format that can be used for analysis. Data pre-processing also involves normalizing the data to ensure that each feature has a similar scale, which can help improve the performance of the model. Overall, data pre-processing plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data is of high quality and can be used effectively for training and testing machine learning models.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Incomplete data:** This occurs when some of the data is missing, which can result in biased or inaccurate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect data:** This occurs when the data is incorrect, either due to human error or technical issues. Incorrect data can lead to incorrect model predictions, which can be problematic in many applications.\n",

    "**Imbalanced data:** This occurs when the data is imbalanced, meaning that one class or category is overrepresented in the dataset. This can lead to biased models, which may not perform well on unseen data.\n",

    "**Outliers:** This occurs when the data contains outliers, which are values that are significantly different from the rest of the data. Outliers can negatively affect model performance by skewing the model towards these extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ramifications of these data issues can be significant. Incomplete, incorrect, or inconsistent data can lead to biased or inaccurate models, which can result in incorrect predictions or recommendations. Imbalanced data can lead to models that are biased towards the overrepresented class, which may not perform well on unseen data. Outliers can lead to models that are overfit to the data, which may not generalize well to new data. Therefore, it is crucial to address these data issues before training machine learning models to ensure that the models are reliable and accurate"

It is calculated as the difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1) of the data. The IQR can be used to identify the range of the typical values in a dataset and to detect potential outliers. A common criterion for assessing the IQR is that values outside the range of 1.5 times the IQR below Q1 or above Q3 are considered outliers.\n",

The box itself represents the IQR, with the lower and upper bounds of the box corresponding to Q1 and Q3, respectively. The median is represented by a horizontal line inside the box. The whiskers of the box plot extend from the edges of the box to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR from Q1 and Q3, respectively. Points beyond the whiskers are considered potential outliers.\n",
